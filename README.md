# CaptionMate

CaptionMate is a React-based web application that allows users to add timestamps with captions to videos, navigate through the video using these timestamps, and display captions dynamically during playback. This interactive tool is ideal for annotating videos with meaningful captions and timestamps.

## **Features**

1. **Add Timestamps with Captions**:
   - Users can input captions along with their start and end timestamps.
   - A dedicated button allows users to save these timestamps and captions, which are displayed in a table for easy navigation.

2. **Dynamic Caption Bar**:
   - A caption bar dynamically updates to display the caption associated with the current playback time.
   - Captions are cleared from the bar once the playback time exceeds the defined range.

3. **Clickable Captions for Navigation**:
   - Captions in the table are clickable.
   - Clicking on a caption seeks the video to the corresponding timestamp and displays the associated caption in the caption bar.

4. **Video Playback**:
   - Users can load a video using a YouTube URL and play, pause, or seek to specific times based on timestamps.

5. **Responsive and User-Friendly UI**:
   - The application features a clean, responsive layout with sections for video playback, timestamp input, and caption management.
   - Captions and timestamps are displayed in a scrollable table for easy management.
